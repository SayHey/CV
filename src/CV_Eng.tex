\section{Experience}
\subsection{Vocational}
\cventry{2018--Present}
{Tech Lead of Robot Control}
{\newline ARRIVAL Robotics}
{\newline Saint Petersburg, Russia / London, UK}
{}{Development of the industrial robot control software.\newline{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Leading a small team of software developers and mathematicians. The main product of the
      company is the software platform for the flexible fully autonomous robotic assembly line. Our team's main product is a custom robot motion execution system that uses realtime feedback from force sensors and CV to perform flexible atomic robotic operations. My work is to:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item design and implement various feedback controllers and robot motion features
        \item develop the architecture and components of the realtime Linux-based driver software that wrap those features and communicate with the hardware
        \item analyze data from sensors and metrological systems
        \item manage tasks for the team, communicate with other teams, higher management and external partners (universities, contractors, etc), present for the internal demos, investors, universities, etc

{\newline Saint Petersburg, Russia / Copenhagen, Denmark}
{}{Development of mathematical core for CAD/CAM software.\newline{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Worked on the large new project of NC machine toolpath generation software.
      I have implemented several 3-axis milling machining strategies, including 
      some unique cutting edge strategies that didn't exist before. My work consisted of designing complex computational geometry algorithms to handle and process 3d objects and
      then implementing these algorithms into the library using c++ .\newline
